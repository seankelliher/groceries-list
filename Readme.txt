Interactive grocery list that compiles items and calculates total cost.

Interactive grocery list that compiles the items and prices the user has entered and automatically calculates the list's total cost. Safeguards ensure all items are given a name and all entered prices are numbers only. Individual items can later be removed from the list. Upon doing so, the total cost is re-calculated.

The list has minimal styling. All sizing is relative. You would probably want to add more styling and some media queries for a production model. All functionality is accomplished through "vanilla" JavaScript.
