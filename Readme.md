# Groceries List

Interactive "grocery list" that displays the items and prices a user has entered and calculates the total cost. Safeguards ensure that all items are given a name and all entered prices are numbers only. Individual items can later be removed from the list. Upon doing so, the total cost is re-calculated.

The list has minimal styling. All sizing is relative. You would probably want to add more styling and some media queries for a production model.
